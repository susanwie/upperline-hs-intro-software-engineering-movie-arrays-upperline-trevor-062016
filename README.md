Sometimes it's hard to keep up with your Netflix movie queue. Sometimes, all you need is a Friday night to binge watch Scandal.

We're going to use arrays to manipulate our own movie Queue.

Open this lab in Nitrous. Run `learn` in terminal to run the Rspec tests. Use those tests as guidance to code your solution in `movies.rb`.

###Step 1: 

Define a method `first_movie` that returns the first movie in the queue. This method should accept an array as an argument (the movie queue)

####Step 2: 

Define a method `watch_movie` that deletes the first movie in the array and returns the modified array. This method should accept an array as an argument (the movie queue).

####Step 3: 

Define a method `update_queue` that returns the updated array. This method takes two arguments (the array of movies and the movie you want to add to the queue).

####Step 4:

Define a method `view_queue` that uses the each method to iterate over the array of movies. This method should use puts to print out "You will watch [movie name]" for every movie in the list. This method should accept an array as an argument (the movie queue).
